# SenateInfoPage
A site to track US Senator Data using JavaScript

for the graders:

Step 1
- step one is accomplished in the section that reads Parties and the section called Leaders.
- the parties and number, as well as the leader info is read in from the JSON, not hardcoded.
- The leaders are grouped by party

Step 2
- All the senators are listed in a table in the Senators section (you can vertically scroll to see the whole table).
- Senators have required info listed and all if brought in from the JSON file, not hardcoded.
- The senators are grouped by party, and within parties, grouped by state alphabetically

Step 3
- We have 3 filters, one for party, one for state and one for rank next to the Senators table in the Senators section
- they all default to showing all, but you can select multiple options in each one to filter.
- You can combine any and all filters at once to narrow down your selection further.
- you can reset individual filters with the 'All' button, or reset all 3 filters to show all with the 'Reset Filter' button.
- we also added functionality that when you deselect all options it automatically reverts to show all.
- the filters keep the senators grouped by party when possible.
- All filter options are populated from the JSON, not hardcoded.

Step 4
- You can click any row in the senators table to view the additional required information in the 'Senator Information' window.
- The displayed senator will be bold in the Senator table.
- We include youtube and twitter IDs when applicable and default to N/A when they are not provided.
- All additional info is populated from the JSON, not hardcoded.
-The Website link is clickable and will open their website in a new window.
